# Project-1__TimeSeriesAnalysis
Time series analysis of the S&amp;P500 index (SARIMA models)

In this Jupyter notebook we analyze the S&P500 index. We use daily data for the S&P500 index from January 1928 to November 2020. The data is obtained from Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?ltr=1). We use the SARIMAX model from statsmodels to fit and predict daily observations of the S&P500 index.
